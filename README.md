# Does the dosage of pre-operative steroids impact hospital length of stay after pituitary adenoma resection?

## Overview
This project investigates the potential impact of pre-operative steroid dosage on the length of hospital stay following pituitary adenoma resection. While the questions and hypotheses are based on real-world concerns within the field of Endocrinology, it's important to note that the data analyzed in this study is simulated. The aim is to explore if there's a significant correlation between steroid dosage and recovery time in a controlled, hypothetical scenario.

## Sub-Field of Study
Endocrinology (Physiology): The study focuses on pituitary adenomas, which are tumors arising from the pituitary gland. This gland plays a crucial role in regulating vital bodily functions through hormone production and regulation.

## Rationale
Pituitary adenomas can lead to severe symptoms and complications due to hormonal imbalances, including growth disturbances, metabolic abnormalities, and reproductive dysfunction. Early detection and appropriate management can prevent complications such as morbidity and mortality. This study aims to assess whether the administration of pre-operative steroids affects the hospital stay duration, potentially indicating a faster recovery process.

## Disclaimer
This research analyzes simulated data for educational and exploratory purposes. The results and conclusions drawn from this study should not be interpreted as clinically valid.
